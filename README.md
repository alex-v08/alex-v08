# Hi there, I'm Alex Velasquez! 👋
## AI Agent Architect | Automation Engineer | Backend Specialist

I specialize in engineering intelligence into business processes. My passion lies in building **autonomous agentic workflows** and complex backend systems, while sharing the journey and the "how-to" behind every innovation. I don't just build tools; I create ecosystems where AI and human action converge.

### 🚀 Innovation & Agentic AI

- **🤖 Agentic Orchestration:** Architecting **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers to empower LLMs with real-world tools.
- **⚙️ Advanced Automation:** Expert in **n8n** for high-complexity flows—from transcribing Telegram voice notes with **Whisper** to intelligent lead distribution systems for real estate.
- **🧠 Practical AI:** Implementing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for legal and academic sectors, focusing on data isolation and semantic precision.

### 🏗️ Complex Engineering & Reliability

- **UGR Conecta:** Optimized massive university management systems, solving critical SQL performance bottlenecks and implementing architectural monitoring.
- **Backend Mastery:** Robust development in **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Go**, utilizing **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Clean Code** to ensure long-term scalability.
- **Infrastructure:** Running local AI clusters (Raspberry Pi/Linux) to test and deploy private, secure LLM environments.
