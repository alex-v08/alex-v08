</p>

*   **Technical Leadership:** Proven track record leading multidisciplinary teams using Agile frameworks to deliver scalable software solutions.
*   **Complex Systems (EdTech):** End-to-end development of a mission-critical **Academic Management Engine**. Built with **Java 21** and **Micronaut**, featuring complex SQL optimization, JWT/OAuth2 security with Keycloak, and full containerization for large-scale university environments.
*   **Backend Mastery:** Robust development in Java and Go, ensuring reliability through Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Code principles.

</p>

*   **Pragmatic AI Integration:** Constantly evolving my stack with the latest technologies (Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Antigravity). I leverage tools like **Claude Code** for high-level reasoning while utilizing **OpenCode** for customized Spec-Driven Development (SDD).
*   **LLM Flexibility:** My projects are not tied to "hype"; I strategically select between Cloud LLMs or Local models (Ollama/DeepSeek) depending on security, cost, and complexity requirements.
*   **Agentic Orchestration:** Architecting Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to bridge the gap between LLMs and real-world business tool execution.

### Featured Projects
*   **Academic Management Engine:** A high-performance core for the education industry developed solo, focusing on massive data processing and secure authentication flows.
*   **Agen-ce:** AI Agent for **Argentine Foreign Trade**, bridging regulatory complexity with actionable data using custom agentic workflows.
*   **Lead Distribution System:** Production-ready automation for the **Real Estate industry** that utilizes AI for sentiment analysis and round-robin assignment.

### Building in Public & Mentorship
I advocate for technical transparency. I document and share my implementations to mentor other developers in navigating the complexities of AI agents and modern backend architecture.
